# DESCRIPTION

This module extends [Apache::Session](https://metacpan.org/pod/Apache%3A%3ASession) to create secure random session ids using the system's source of randomness.

# REQUIREMENTS

This module lists the following modules as runtime dependencies:

- [Crypt::SysRandom](https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt%3A%3ASysRandom)
- [perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/perl) version 5.006 or later
- [strict](https://metacpan.org/pod/strict)
- [warnings](https://metacpan.org/pod/warnings)

See the `cpanfile` file for the full list of prerequisites.

# INSTALLATION

The latest version of this module (along with any dependencies) can be installed from [CPAN](https://www.cpan.org) with the `cpan` tool that is included with Perl:

```
cpan Apache::Session::Generate::Random
```

You can also extract the distribution archive and install this module (along with any dependencies):

```
cpan .
```

You can also install this module manually using the following commands:
